## Get your little ones around the camp fire! Get them learning programming before bed.

We will share our large amount of resources we use to have something new and fun to work on. Each night we work together to learning programming. We will go over how we kept programming fun for bedtime. We had started with the very basics and slowly added over time. From the "Hour of Code" to console apps, raspberry pi development and even some game programming with Unity.  This started during covid while kids were doing school at home. This year we are doing the #csharpchallenge from @IAmTimCorey, along with trying to make a commit to GitHub each day.  As a seasoned software development architect I also was able to use this time for my benefits too. I was able to play with new tech that was outside of my comfort zone and make it more fun to share the learning process with my kids.
