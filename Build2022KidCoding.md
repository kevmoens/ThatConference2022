Kids want to jump right in and see results quickly

use games to make it fun

# MAKE IT FUN

repitition overtime will generate learning and understanding

revisit old projects later and make changes

typing is one of the biggest hurldes.  Goal is a quick dev loop

don't start with basic computer programming concepts.  Just JUMP IN

Eventually kids will want more of a challenge 
    example: move from blockly to a typed language

eventually go to typing 
    When you do start back with premade code / step by 
        Have them code / debug

For parent it is a lot of work to think ahead & find what keeps kid interested.

Find a coding club

be patient, small steps matter

POSITIVE EXPERIENCE
